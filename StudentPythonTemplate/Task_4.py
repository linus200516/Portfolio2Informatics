# Task 4 [5 points out of 30] Similarities
#
# Independent inquiry time! In Task 1, you were instructed to use similarity and distance measures that were prepared
# by the teacher beforehand. Now itâ€™s time to implement your own.
#
# On your own, implement the RGB image versions of cosine similarity and RMSE distance. You can use functions for basic
# image transformations (such as flattening) and you can use functions for calculating the root or power.
# The remaining elements, such as dot product, average, sum, etc., need to be implemented on your own.
#
# You can start working on this task immediately. Please consult at the very least Week 1 materials.
