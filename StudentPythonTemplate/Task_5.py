# Task 5 [5 points out of 30] I can do better!
#
# Independent inquiry time! There are much better approaches out there for image classification.
# Your task is to find one and analyse it:
# •	State the name of the approach
# •	Provide a permalink to a resource in the Cardiff University library that describes the approach AND
#   include an appropriate reference
# •	Briefly explain how the approach you found is better than kNN in image classification.
#   Focus on synthesis, not recall!
#
# The reference can be in any format you wish but has to contain all necessary components.
# You can start working on this task immediately. Please consult at the very least Week 2 materials.
